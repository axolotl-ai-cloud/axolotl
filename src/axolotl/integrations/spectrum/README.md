## Spectrum: Targeted Training on Signal to Noise Ratio

by Eric Hartford, Lucas Atkins, et al.

This plugin contains code to freeze the bottom fraction of modules in a model, based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

### Overview

Spectrum is a tool for scanning and evaluating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of layers in large language models.
By identifying the top n% of layers with the highest SNR, you can optimize training efficiency.
