title: "LoRA Optimizations"
description: "Custom autograd functions and Triton kernels in Axolotl for optimized LoRA fine-tuning"
---

Inspired by [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth), we've implemented two
optimizations for LoRA and QLoRA fine-tuning, supporting both single GPU and multi-GPU
(in the DDP and DeepSpeed settings) training. These include (1) SwiGLU and GEGLU activation function
Triton kernels, and (2) LoRA MLP and attention custom autograd functions. Our goal was
to leverage operator fusion and tensor re-use in order to improve speed and reduce
memory usage during the forward and backward passes of these calculations.

We currently support several common model architectures, including (but not limited to):

- `llama`
- `mistral`
- `qwen2`
- `gemma`
- `gemma2`

<details>

The set of models we support is currently limited by our attention patching strategy,
which assumes (and replaces) specific code blocks for query / key / value and output
projections:

```python
ORIGINAL_QKV_CODE = """
    query_states = self.q_proj(hidden_states).view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
    key_states = self.k_proj(hidden_states).view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
    value_states = self.v_proj(hidden_states).view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
""".lstrip(
    "\n"
)

ORIGINAL_O_CODE = """
    attn_output = self.o_proj(attn_output)
""".lstrip(
    "\n"
)
```

Is replaced with:

```python
PATCHED_QKV_CODE = """
    query_states, key_states, value_states = self.apply_qkv(hidden_states)
    query_states = query_states.view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
    key_states = key_states.view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
    value_states = value_states.view(hidden_shape).transpose(1, 2)
""".lstrip(
    "\n"
)

PATCHED_O_CODE = """
    attn_output = self.apply_o(attn_output)
""".lstrip(
    "\n"
)
```

Where `apply_qkv` and `apply_o` are defined in the `axolotl.kernels.lora` module.

We welcome testing of other model architectures and / or PRs to expand our patching
logic to be compatible with more of them.

## Usage

These optimizations can be enabled in your Axolotl config YAML file. The
`lora_mlp_kernel` option enables the optimized MLP path, while `lora_qkv_kernel` and
`lora_o_kernel` enable the fused query-key-value projection and optimized output
projection, respectively.

```yaml
lora_mlp_kernel: true
lora_qkv_kernel: true
lora_o_kernel: true
```

## Requirements

- One or more NVIDIA or AMD GPUs (in order to use the Triton kernels)
    - Note: Set `TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` to enable [memory-efficient attention on AMD GPUs](https://github.com/ROCm/aotriton/issues/16#issuecomment-2346675491)
- Targeted LoRA adapters cannot use Dropout
    - This may limit model expressivity / cause overfitting
- Targeted LoRA adapters cannot have bias terms
    - This may limit model expressivity

Models with pre-existing LoRA adapters that use Dropout or have bias terms may need to
be re-finetuned without these features in order to be useful.

## Implementation details

### Custom autograd functions

The LoRA MLP autograd function optimizes the entire MLP computation path. It fuses the
LoRA and base weight computations together and provides a single, efficient backward
pass for the entire MLP block.

For attention components, similar optimizations are provided through a function that
handles the query, key, and value projections, and a function that handles the output
projection. They are designed to work with the existing `transformers` attention
implementation via some monkey-patching logic.

### Triton kernels

Two activation functions (SwiGLU and GeGLU) are implemented with Triton kernels for
improved speed and memory performance. These kernels handle both the forward and
backward passes.

### Integration

The custom autograd functions and Triton kernels are designed to work together. The
autograd function manages the high-level computation flow and gradient tracking, while
calling the Triton kernels for the activation function computation. During the backward
pass, the kernel computes both the activation output and the required gradients, which
the autograd function then uses to compute the final gradients for the entire
computation path.

## Future Work

- Support for additional model architectures
- Support for the FSDP setting
- Support for dropout and bias
- Additional operator fusions
