### Overview

Reward modelling is a technique used to train models to predict the reward or value of a given input. This is particularly useful in reinforcement learning scenarios where the model needs to evaluate the quality of its actions or predictions.
We support the reward modelling techniques supported by `trl`.

### (Outcome) Reward Models

Outcome reward models are trained using data which contains preference annotations for an entire interaction between the user and model (e.g. rather than per-turn or per-step).

```yaml
base_model: google/gemma-2-2b
model_type: AutoModelForSequenceClassification
num_labels: 1
tokenizer_type: AutoTokenizer

reward_model: true
chat_template: gemma
datasets:
  - path: argilla/distilabel-intel-orca-dpo-pairs
    type: bradley_terry.chat_template

val_set_size: 0.1
eval_steps: 100
```

### Process Reward Models (PRM)

Process reward models are trained using data which contains preference annotations for each step in a series of interactions. Typically, PRMs are trained to provide reward signals over each step of a reasoning trace and are used for downstream reinforcement learning.
```yaml
base_model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B
model_type: AutoModelForTokenClassification
num_labels: 2

process_reward_model: true
datasets:
  - path: trl-lib/math_shepherd
    type: stepwise_supervised
    split: train

val_set_size: 0.1
eval_steps: 100
```
