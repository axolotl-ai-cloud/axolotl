This guide will walk you through your first model fine-tuning project with Axolotl.

## Quick Example {#sec-quick-example}

Let's start by fine-tuning a small language model using LoRA. This example uses a 1B parameter model to ensure it runs on most GPUs.
Assuming `axolotl` is installed (if not, see our [Installation Guide](installation.qmd))

1. Download example configs:
```bash
axolotl fetch examples
```

2. Run the training:
```bash
axolotl train examples/llama-3/lora-1b.yml
```

That's it! Let's understand what just happened.

## Understanding the Process {#sec-understanding}

### The Configuration File {#sec-config}

The YAML configuration file controls everything about your training. Here's what (part of) our example config looks like:

```yaml
base_model: NousResearch/Llama-3.2-1B
# hub_model_id: username/custom_model_name

datasets:
  - path: teknium/GPT4-LLM-Cleaned
    type: alpaca
dataset_prepared_path: last_run_prepared
val_set_size: 0.1
output_dir: ./outputs/lora-out

adapter: lora
lora_model_dir:
```

See our [Config options](config.qmd) for more details.

### Training {#sec-training}

When you run `axolotl train`, Axolotl:

1. Downloads the base model
2. (If specified) applies LoRA adapter layers
3. Loads and processes the dataset
4. Runs the training loop
5. Saves the trained model and / or LoRA weights

## Your First Custom Training {#sec-custom}

Let's modify the example for your own data:

1. Create a new config file `my_training.yml`:

```yaml
base_model: NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-llama-1b-v1
adapter: lora

# Training settings
micro_batch_size: 2
num_epochs: 3
learning_rate: 0.0003

# Your dataset
datasets:
  - path: my_data.jsonl        # Your local data file
    type: alpaca               # Or other format
```

This specific config is for LoRA fine-tuning a model with instruction tuning data using
the `alpaca` dataset format, which has the following format:

```json
{
    "instruction": "Write a description of alpacas.",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Alpacas are domesticated South American camelids..."
}
```

Please see our [Dataset Formats](dataset-formats) for more dataset formats and how to
format them.

2. Prepare your JSONL data in the specified format (in this case, the expected `alpaca
format):

```json
{"instruction": "Classify this text", "input": "I love this!", "output": "positive"}
{"instruction": "Classify this text", "input": "Not good at all", "output": "negative"}
```

Please consult the supported [Dataset Formats](dataset-formats/) for more details.

3. Run the training:

```bash
axolotl train my_training.yml
```

## Common Tasks {#sec-common-tasks}

### Testing Your Model {#sec-testing}

After training, test your model:

```bash
axolotl inference my_training.yml --lora-model-dir="./outputs/lora-out"
```

### Preprocessing Data {#sec-preprocessing}

For large datasets, preprocess first:

```bash
axolotl preprocess my_training.yml
```

### Using a UI {#sec-ui}

Launch a Gradio interface:

```bash
axolotl inference my_training.yml --lora-model-dir="./outputs/lora-out" --gradio
```

## Next Steps {#sec-next-steps}

Now that you have the basics, you might want to:

- Try different model architectures
- Experiment with hyperparameters
- Use more advanced training methods
- Scale up to larger models
