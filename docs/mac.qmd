description: Mac M-series support
---

Currently Axolotl on Mac is partially usable, many of the dependencies of Axolotl including Pytorch do not support MPS or have incomplete support.

Current support:

- [x] Support for all models
- [x] Full training of models
- [x] LoRA training
- [x] Sample packing
- [ ] FP16 and BF16 (awaiting AMP support for MPS in Pytorch)
- [ ] Tri-dao's flash-attn (until it is supported use spd_attention as an alternative)
- [ ] xformers
- [ ] bitsandbytes (meaning no 4/8 bits loading and bnb optimizers)
- [ ] qlora
- [ ] DeepSpeed

Untested:

- FSDP
