**Q: Exitcode -9**

> A: This usually happens when you run out of system RAM.

**Q: Exitcode -7 while using deepspeed**

> A: Try upgrading deepspeed w: `pip install -U deepspeed`

**Q: AttributeError: 'DummyOptim' object has no attribute 'step'**

> A: You may be using deepspeed with single gpu. Please don't set `deepspeed:` in yaml or cli.

**Q: The codes is stuck on saving preprocessed datasets.**

> A: This is usually an issue with the GPU. This can be resolved through setting the os environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`. If you are on runpod, this is usually a pod issue. Starting a new pod should take care of it.

**Q: `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'content' / 'role' / ____`**

> A: This means that the property mapping for the stated attribute does not exist when building `chat_template` prompt. For example, if `no attribute 'content'`, please check you have added the correct mapping for `content` under `message_property_mappings`.
