## Stepwise Supervised

The stepwise supervised format is designed for chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning
datasets where each example contains multiple completion steps and a preference label
for each step.

### Example

Here's a simple example of a stepwise supervised dataset entry:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Which number is larger, 9.8 or 9.11?",
  "completions": [
    "The fractional part of 9.8 is 0.8, while the fractional part of 9.11 is 0.11.",
    "Since 0.11 is greater than 0.8, the number 9.11 is larger than 9.8."
  ],
  "labels": [true, false]
}
```
