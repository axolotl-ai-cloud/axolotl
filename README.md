## Quickstart ⚡

Get started with Axolotl in just a few steps! This quickstart guide will walk you through setting up and running a basic fine-tuning task.

**Requirements**: Python >=3.9 and Pytorch >=2.0.

`pip3 install "axolotl[flash-attn,deepspeed] @ git+https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl"`

### For developers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl
cd axolotl

pip3 install packaging
pip3 install -e '.[flash-attn,deepspeed]'
```

### Usage
```bash
# finetune lora
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train examples/openllama-3b/lora.yml

# inference
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/openllama-3b/lora.yml \
    --lora_model_dir="./lora-out"

# gradio
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/openllama-3b/lora.yml \
    --lora_model_dir="./lora-out" --gradio
```

## Installation

### Environment

#### Docker
  ```bash
  docker run --gpus '"all"' --rm -it winglian/axolotl:main-py3.10-cu118-2.0.1
  ```

  Or run on the current files for development:

  ```sh
  docker compose up -d
  ```

  <details>

  <summary>Docker advanced</summary>

  A more powerful Docker command to run would be this:

  ```bash
  docker run --privileged --gpus '"all"' --shm-size 10g --rm -it --name axolotl --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --mount type=volume,src=axolotl,target=/workspace/axolotl -v ${HOME}/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface winglian/axolotl:main-py3.10-cu118-2.0.1
  ```

  It additionally:
  * Prevents memory issues when running e.g. deepspeed (e.g. you could hit SIGBUS/signal 7 error) through `--ipc` and `--ulimit` args.
  * Persists the downloaded HF data (models etc.) and your modifications to axolotl code through `--mount`/`-v` args.
  * The `--name` argument simply makes it easier to refer to the container in vscode (`Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container...`) or in your terminal.
  * The `--privileged` flag gives all capabilities to the container.
  * The `--shm-size 10g` argument increases the shared memory size. Use this if you see `exitcode: -7` errors using deepspeed.

#### Launching on public clouds via SkyPilot
To launch on GPU instances (both on-demand and spot instances) on 7+ clouds (GCP, AWS, Azure, OCI, and more), you can use [SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):
```bash
pip install "skypilot-nightly[gcp,aws,azure,oci,lambda,kubernetes,ibm,scp]"  # choose your clouds
sky check
```
Get the [example YAMLs](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot/tree/master/llm/axolotl) of using Axolotl to finetune `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`:
```
git clone https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot.git
cd skypilot/llm/axolotl
```
Use one command to launch:
```bash
# On-demand
HF_TOKEN=xx sky launch axolotl.yaml --env HF_TOKEN

# Managed spot (auto-recovery on preemption)
HF_TOKEN=xx BUCKET=<unique-name> sky spot launch axolotl-spot.yaml --env HF_TOKEN --env BUCKET
```

#### How to add custom prompts

For a dataset that is preprocessed for instruction purposes:

```json
{"instruction": "...", "output": "..."}
```

You can use this example in your YAML config:

```yaml
datasets:
  - path: repo
    type:
      system_prompt: ""
      field_system: system
      format: "[INST] {instruction} [/INST]"
      no_input_format: "[INST] {instruction} [/INST]"
```

#### How to use your custom pretokenized dataset

- Do not pass a `type:`
- Columns in Dataset must be exactly `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `labels`


### Config

See [examples](examples) for quick start. It is recommended to duplicate and modify to your needs. The most important options are:

- model
  ```yaml
  base_model: ./llama-7b-hf # local or huggingface repo
  ```
  Note: The code will load the right architecture.

- dataset
  ```yaml
  sequence_len: 2048 # max token length for prompt

  # huggingface repo
  datasets:
    - path: vicgalle/alpaca-gpt4
      type: alpaca # format from earlier

  # huggingface repo with specific configuration/subset
  datasets:
    - path: EleutherAI/pile
      name: enron_emails
      type: completion # format from earlier
      field: text # Optional[str] default: text, field to use for completion data

  # huggingface repo with multiple named configurations/subsets
  datasets:
    - path: bigcode/commitpackft
      name:
        - ruby
        - python
        - typescript
      type: ... # unimplemented custom format

  # fastchat conversation
  # See 'conversation' options: https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/conversation.py
  datasets:
    - path: ...
      type: sharegpt
      conversation: chatml

  # local
  datasets:
    - path: data.jsonl # or json
      ds_type: json # see other options below
      type: alpaca

  # dataset with splits, but no train split
  dataset:
    - path: knowrohit07/know_sql
      type: context_qa.load_v2
      train_on_split: validation

  # loading from s3 or gcs
  # s3 creds will be loaded from the system default and gcs only supports public access
  dataset:
    - path: s3://path_to_ds # Accepts folder with arrow/parquet or file path like above. Supports s3, gcs.
      ...
  ```

- loading
  ```yaml
  load_in_4bit: true
  load_in_8bit: true
  bf16: true # require >=ampere
  fp16: true
  tf32: true # require >=ampere
  bfloat16: true # require >=ampere, use instead of bf16 when you don't want AMP (automatic mixed precision)
  float16: true # use instead of fp16 when you don't want AMP
  ```
  Note: Repo does not do 4-bit quantization.

- lora
  ```yaml
  adapter: lora # qlora or leave blank for full finetune
  lora_r: 8
  lora_alpha: 16
  lora_dropout: 0.05
  lora_target_modules:

<summary> Understanding of batch size and gradient accumulation steps </summary>
<br/>
Gradient accumulation means accumulating gradients over several mini-batches and updating the model weights afterward. When the samples in each batch are diverse, this technique doesn't significantly impact learning.

This method allows for effective training with larger effective batch sizes without needing proportionally larger memory. Here's why:

1. **Memory Consumption with Batch Size**: The primary reason increasing the batch size impacts memory is due to the storage requirements for intermediate activations. When you forward propagate a batch through a network, you have to store the activations at each layer for each sample in the batch, because these activations are used during backpropagation to compute gradients. Therefore, larger batches mean more activations, leading to greater GPU memory consumption.

2. **Gradient Accumulation**: With gradient accumulation, you're effectively simulating a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over several smaller batches (or micro-batches). However, at any given time, you're only forward and backward propagating a micro-batch. This means you only store activations for the micro-batch, not the full accumulated batch. As a result, you can simulate the effect of a larger batch size without the memory cost of storing activations for a large batch.

**Example 1:**
Micro batch size: 3
Gradient accumulation steps: 2
Number of GPUs: 3
Total batch size = 3 * 2 * 3 = 18

```
| GPU 1          | GPU 2          | GPU 3          |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| S1, S2, S3     | S4, S5, S6     | S7, S8, S9     |
| e1, e2, e3     | e4, e5, e6     | e7, e8, e9     |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| → (accumulate) | → (accumulate) | → (accumulate) |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| S10, S11, S12  | S13, S14, S15  | S16, S17, S18  |
| e10, e11, e12  | e13, e14, e15  | e16, e17, e18  |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| → (apply)      | → (apply)      | → (apply)      |

Accumulated gradient for the weight w1 after the second iteration (considering all GPUs):
Total gradient for w1 = e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + e5 + e6 + e7 + e8 + e9 + e10 + e11 + e12 + e13 + e14 + e15 + e16 + e17 + e18

Weight update for w1:
w1_new = w1_old - learning rate x (Total gradient for w1 / 18)
```

**Example 2:**
Micro batch size: 2
Gradient accumulation steps: 1
Number of GPUs: 3
Total batch size = 2 * 1 * 3 = 6

```
| GPU 1     | GPU 2     | GPU 3     |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| S1, S2    | S3, S4    | S5, S6    |
| e1, e2    | e3, e4    | e5, e6    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| → (apply) | → (apply) | → (apply) |

Accumulated gradient for the weight w1 (considering all GPUs):
Total gradient for w1 = e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + e5 + e6

Weight update for w1:
w1_new = w1_old - learning rate × (Total gradient for w1 / 6)
```

### Train

Run
```bash
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train your_config.yml
```

#### Preprocess dataset

You can optionally pre-tokenize dataset with the following before finetuning.
This is recommended for large datasets.

- Set `dataset_prepared_path:` to a local folder for saving and loading pre-tokenized dataset.
- (Optional): Set `push_dataset_to_hub: hf_user/repo` to push it to Huggingface.
- (Optional): Use `--debug` to see preprocessed examples.

```bash
python -m axolotl.cli.preprocess your_config.yml
```

#### Multi-GPU

Below are the options available in axolotl for training with multiple GPUs. Note that DeepSpeed
is the recommended multi-GPU option currently because FSDP may experience
[loss instability](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/26498).

##### DeepSpeed

Deepspeed is an optimization suite for multi-gpu systems allowing you to train much larger models than you
might typically be able to fit into your GPU's VRAM. More information about the various optimization types
for deepspeed is available at https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/deepspeed#what-is-integrated

We provide several default deepspeed JSON configurations for ZeRO stage 1, 2, and 3.

```yaml
deepspeed: deepspeed/zero1.json
```

```shell
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train examples/llama-2/config.py --deepspeed deepspeed/zero1.json
```

##### FSDP

- llama FSDP
```yaml
fsdp:
  - full_shard
  - auto_wrap
fsdp_config:
  fsdp_offload_params: true
  fsdp_state_dict_type: FULL_STATE_DICT
  fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap: LlamaDecoderLayer
```

##### Weights & Biases Logging

Make sure your `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable is set (recommended) or you login to wandb with `wandb login`.

- wandb options
```yaml
wandb_mode:
wandb_project:
wandb_entity:
wandb_watch:
wandb_name:
wandb_log_model:
```

##### Special Tokens

It is important to have special tokens like delimiters, end-of-sequence, beginning-of-sequence in your tokenizer's vocabulary.  This will help you avoid tokenization issues and help your model train better.  You can do this in axolotl like this:

```yml
special_tokens:
  bos_token: "<s>"
  eos_token: "</s>"
  unk_token: "<unk>"
tokens: # these are delimiters
  - "<|im_start|>"
  - "<|im_end|>"
```

When you include these tokens in your axolotl config, axolotl adds these tokens to the tokenizer's vocabulary.

### Inference Playground

Axolotl allows you to load your model in an interactive terminal playground for quick experimentation.
The config file is the same config file used for training.

Pass the appropriate flag to the inference command, depending upon what kind of model was trained:

- Pretrained LORA:
  ```bash
  python -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/your_config.yml --lora_model_dir="./lora-output-dir"
  ```
- Full weights finetune:
  ```bash
  python -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/your_config.yml --base_model="./completed-model"
  ```
- Full weights finetune w/ a prompt from a text file:
  ```bash
  cat /tmp/prompt.txt | python -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/your_config.yml \
    --base_model="./completed-model" --prompter=None --load_in_8bit=True
  ```
-- With gradio hosting
  ```bash
  python -m axolotl.cli.inference examples/your_config.yml --gradio
  ```

Please use `--sample_packing False` if you have it on and receive the error similar to below:

> RuntimeError: stack expects each tensor to be equal size, but got [1, 32, 1, 128] at entry 0 and [1, 32, 8, 128] at entry 1

### Merge LORA to base

The following command will merge your LORA adapater with your base model.  You can optionally pass the argument `--lora_model_dir` to specify the directory where your LORA adapter was saved, otherwhise, this will be inferred from `output_dir` in your axolotl config file.  The merged model is saved in the sub-directory `{lora_model_dir}/merged`.

```bash
python3 -m axolotl.cli.merge_lora your_config.yml --lora_model_dir="./completed-model"
```

You may need to use the `gpu_memory_limit` and/or `lora_on_cpu` config options to avoid running out of memory. If you still run out of CUDA memory, you can try to merge in system RAM with

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python3 -m axolotl.cli.merge_lora ...
```

although this will be very slow, and using the config options above are recommended instead.

## Common Errors 🧰

See also the [FAQ's](./docs/faq.md).

> If you encounter a 'Cuda out of memory' error, it means your GPU ran out of memory during the training process. Here's how to resolve it:

Please reduce any below
  - `micro_batch_size`
  - `eval_batch_size`
  - `gradient_accumulation_steps`
  - `sequence_len`

If it does not help, try running without deepspeed and without accelerate (replace "accelerate launch" with "python") in the command.

Using adamw_bnb_8bit might also save you some memory.

> `failed (exitcode: -9)`

Usually means your system has run out of system memory.
Similarly, you should consider reducing the same settings as when you run out of VRAM.
Additionally, look into upgrading your system RAM which should be simpler than GPU upgrades.

> RuntimeError: expected scalar type Float but found Half

Try set `fp16: true`

> NotImplementedError: No operator found for `memory_efficient_attention_forward` ...

Try to turn off xformers.

> accelerate config missing

It's safe to ignore it.

> NCCL Timeouts during training

See the [NCCL](docs/nccl.md) guide.


### Tokenization Mismatch b/w Inference & Training

For many formats, Axolotl constructs prompts by concatenating token ids _after_ tokenizing strings.  The reason for concatenating token ids rather than operating on strings is to maintain precise accounting for attention masks.

If you decode a prompt constructed by axolotl, you might see spaces between tokens (or lack thereof) that you do not expect, especially around delimiters and special tokens.  When you are starting out with a new format, you should always do the following:

1. Materialize some data using `python -m axolotl.cli.preprocess your_config.yml --debug`, and then decode the first few rows with your model's tokenizer.
2. During inference, right before you pass a tensor of token ids to your model, decode these tokens back into a string.
3. Make sure the inference string from #2 looks **exactly** like the data you fine tuned on from #1, including spaces and new lines.  If they aren't the same adjust your inference server accordingly.
4. As an additional troubleshooting step, you can look look at the token ids between 1 and 2 to make sure they are identical.

Having misalignment between your prompts during training and inference can cause models to perform very poorly, so it is worth checking this.  See [this blog post](https://hamel.dev/notes/llm/05_tokenizer_gotchas.html) for a concrete example.
